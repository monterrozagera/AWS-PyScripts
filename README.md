# AWS-PyScripts

**AWS-PyScripts** is a collection of Python scripts designed to help security engineers and cloud practitioners **analyze and audit the security posture** of AWS infrastructure.

These scripts use the [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) AWS SDK and CLI to check for common misconfigurations, insecure resources, and best practice violations â€” all from the command line.
